# 3-Axis-CNC-Machine

Instead of using the infamous GRBL Library with the CNC Shield and the Polulu stepper motor Drivers for generally smaller stepper motor control, we will use another controller for a more professional outcome named YOOCNC-NT65-3X.We can ran the controller with Mach3 CNC controller software.
